            <h3>Wall Climbing Glass Cleaner Robot</h3>
            <p>
                Abstract:
                The objective of this study and its associated endeavor is to develop an affordable and readily producible robotic device capable of scaling walls for the purpose of cleaning high-rise buildings. This innovation is particularly relevant in situations when human intervention poses a risk to safety. In order to facilitate the adherence of the robot to vertical surfaces, the method of propeller thrust was implemented. In order to establish a sufficient level of force for the purpose of connecting the entirety of the robot's body to the wall during the climbing process, a comprehensive calculation was conducted. The experimental determination of the friction coefficient of the robot's rubber wheels was conducted on a whiteboard. The programming code utilized in the robot constitutes a crucial element that needs meticulous development to ensure optimal functionality. The cleaning mechanism of this robot was tailored to its specific needs, and the selection of the chassis material was determined by careful analysis of stress and deformation calculations. In order to maintain the stability and efficiency of the robot, careful consideration was given to both the distribution of overall weight and the designs of its components. Notwithstanding the nascent stage of this project, more investigation and advancement have the potential to enhance the robot's functionalities and optimize its efficacy. <br><br>
